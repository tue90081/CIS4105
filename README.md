Why is version / source control important?
When you are developing, it is important to track changes you are making to your code. This is especially an important when working on collaborative development. Version/source tracks when changes are made to the code and information on the changes such as who made them and why he or she made the changes/fixes. It also allows backtracking to figure out when an issue or bug was initialized and record the problem so it does not reoccur. The ReadMe file in the project folder allows you to document each specific change made to the verison of the project you are working on.
